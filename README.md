# RoboRadio

## What is this

A Rust implementation of https://radio.pavonz.com (built with Elixir and Phoenix). It works like a real radio, you turn it on (well, in this case, you open the web page) and you listen what's being played at the exact point. The radio goes on alone.

## How it works

RoboRadio loads a playlist from https://soundcloud.com, shuffles the tracks, for each one it will play the song and notify the connected users through websockets. When the songs in the playlist have been all played, it reloads and shuffle the tracks again.

## How to run RoboRadio

### Locally

- clone the repository and run:
  ```sh
  $ cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
  $ cargo make frontend
  $ cargo run
  ```
- or use the `Dockerfile.default` to build a container and run it throught Docker (or Podman). The app will listen on port `8080`. There's a `.env.dist` file with usable ENV settings.

### Deploy

Use the `Dockerfile` included in this repository to deploy on https://fly.io. There's a demo instance at https://funky-radio.fly.dev.
